    **Basic ERDDAP Obs Matching**
    
    This notebook is a demonstration of a basic recommended method to collect SalishSeaCast model field values to match
    ocean observations.
    It uses `xarray` to access the SalishSeaCast model datasets via the ERDDAP server.
    The observations are assumed to be defined by a collection of 4d time-space coordinates in a `pandas.DataFrame`.
    (Those could, of course, be read from a CSV file.)
    The model field values closest to the observations are collected in an `xarray.Dataset` that is converted to a
    `pandas.DataFrame` at the end of the notebook.
